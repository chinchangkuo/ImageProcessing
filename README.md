# Introduction:
This is the repository for identifying bubble cluster configurations composed of 3 large and 3 small bubbles. The image processing algorithm "6bubblepreprocess.py" is  used for: 
1. Detect the bubble cluster 
2. Filter the size of bubble clusters composed by different numbers of large and small bubbles
3. Focus on 3 large and 3 small bubble cluster to classify the configurations
